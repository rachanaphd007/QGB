This project implements three quantum sampling schemes using Qiskit: (2) an n-layer Quantum Galton Box producing a binomial distribution that approximates a Gaussian; (3a) a noiseless all-to-all sampler generating an exponential target distribution; and (3b) a 1D coined Hadamard quantum walk exhibiting ballistic spread. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook (Project_Rachana.ipynb) contains the full implementation and plots, while mathframework.pdf provides the theoretical framework, including definitions, formulas, and derivations. The code is parameterized for different layer counts and distribution settings, allowing easy replication and verification of results.
